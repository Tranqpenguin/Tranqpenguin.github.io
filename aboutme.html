    <h1>About Me</h1>
     
     <p>
       Hello, my Name is Andre Quiroa, and this is my about me page. This is my first semester at URI, I just transferred from CCRI through the JAA program.<br>
       When my friends or family ask what my major is, I tell them Computer Science. I find this field of study most interesting because I enjoy creating something<br>
       from nothing and or figuring out puzzles. From the few coding class there is a lot of that happening while writing code.<br>
